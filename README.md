# 🗳️ General Election 2025 Analysis – SQL Server & Excel Project

This project focuses on analyzing the General Election 2025 data using SQL Server and Excel to uncover meaningful political and demographic insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Cleaned and prepared raw election data using **Microsoft Excel**
- Imported structured data into **SQL Server**, and built relationships across key tables (Votes, Candidates, Constituencies, Parties)
- Used **advanced SQL queries** to extract insights and answer critical questions about voter turnout, party performance, and regional patterns

---

## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Used

- **JOINS** (INNER, LEFT) to combine data from multiple tables
- **Aggregate Functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) for summary metrics
- **Window Functions** (`RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`) for comparative analysis
- **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) to simplify complex logic
- **Subqueries** to filter and summarize nested results

---

## 📊 Example Questions Answered

- Which party performed best in each state?
- What was the average voter turnout by region?
- Who were the top 5 winning candidates by margin?
- How did turnout and performance vary across constituencies?
